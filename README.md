# ComputerSecurity_project
The python program demonstrates how the RSA algorithm works
and plot graphs that show the time required for key generation/decryption/encryption for RSA with different key sizes.
The code will generate random RSA key-pair, will encrypt a short message and will decrypt it back to its original form, 
using the RSA-OAEP padding scheme.
